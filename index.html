    <h2>Attack of the Poachers Film</h2>
    <p>I loved making this film because I got to use my creativity and imagination. My partner Elijah and I were the ones who created this! I think it ended up turning out very good although, we could have made it a bit more sad, saying that it is about gorillas being endangered.</p>

    <h2>Sketch Up Floor Plan</h2>
    <p>This project was fun because we got to use a video tutorial on house to make a cool house. The house ended up having a restroom, two bedrooms, and a kitchen. I  thought it looked very cool at the end but I can't provide you with that picture at the moment. This is the picture of it with no furniture.</p>

    <h2>Amazing Photoshop Title</h2>
    <p>I thought this project was fun because we got to use directions to help us make cool titles! We made many of these but this one was my favorite one. It is my favorite because it has a very simple design but with a little flavor. The flavor is the purple theme it has which makes it very delightful. </p>
