	<h2>George Washington</h2>
 <article>
 <p>I'm George Washington, a Federalist, and I served as president from 1789-1797. I was asked by the people to serve a third term but I declined. Before I was president, I served as a commander in cheif of the continental army. This was during the American Revolutionary War. Being the president, there is obviously going to be some problems that I have to face. One problem was the Whiskey Rebellion. Since our country was in debt, I had to tax something. I decided to tax something that many people love... And that's whiskey. Although, the Americans did not agree with this tax so they started a rebellion. I then acted quickly and stopped them by sending armed forces to scare them, and it worked.
