 <article>
 <p>Hi, I’m James Madison and I was the 4th president of the United States. I served my 2 terms from 1809 to 1817 as a Democratic Republican. I was born March 16, 1751 and lived a good, successful life as a child. I went to Princeton University for 2 years and by then I was already looking for a job in the political scheme of things.I have also made some famous documents myself such as the Federalist Papers and the Bill of Rights. In my presidency, I have made some interesting different decisions such as the choice of going into war. It was something that not anyone of the presidents have done before. It ended fixing our conflict with Britain too so the outcome was overall beneficial. Another interesting fact about me is that I was and still am the shortest ever president at 5 foot 4 inches.
